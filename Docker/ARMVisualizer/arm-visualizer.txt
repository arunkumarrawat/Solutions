Running Locally

If you want to run ArmViz locally, the easiest way is through our pre-built Docker image:

Install Docker

Run docker run -i -d -P ytechie/armviz:v2

Run docker ps to see what port ArmViz is being served on

Launch the browser on the local host with the port obtained from running the "docker ps" command - example: http://localhost:32768
