== Statusimo ==

Overview:

Statusimo is a PowerShell module that is able to generate a Status Page entirely from PowerShell. There are many solutions on the market that allow you to host and build your own Status Page for services you have but usually, it comes at a cost or it has some special requirements one has to meet. Following module generates a static HTML page that contains JavaScript/CSS and HTML in one single file you can put on a server or publish using any way you want.
